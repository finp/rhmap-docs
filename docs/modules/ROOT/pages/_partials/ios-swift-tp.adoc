=== Migrating Apps to Swift 3.0

To migrate your app to Swift 3.0:

. Review the Swift link:https://swift.org/migration-guide/[migration guide]. Note the following Swift 3 coding style changes:
* Name functions and methods according to their side-effects.
** Those without side-effects should read as noun phrases, for example, `x.distance(to: y)`, `i.successor()`.
** Those with side-effects should read as imperative verb phrases, for example, `print(x)`, `x.sort()`, `x.append(y)`.
* Names of types and protocols are `UpperCamelCase`.
* Everything else is `lowerCamelCase`.
+
. Make sure your code is working before migrating.
. Change the Podfile contents to the following:
+
----
    pod 'FeedHenry', '5.0.3'
----
. Install the pod:
+
----
    pod install
----
. Open the Xcode 8.x workspace by double clicking on the ProjectName.xcworkspace.
. When prompted to migrate the code, choose Swift 3. Note the following:
+
* It is unlikely that the app code will compile first time. Fix your code until it passes all unit tests.
* Be aware of the following:
** `sort()` on Array is now a mutable function
** the difference between `Any` and `AnyObject`
** the difference between `Data` and `NSData`
* Consider your API label names using the Swift link:https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/[Api Design Guidelines].
. Build your app locally and validate that everything is working.
