= Using Node.js Modules in Cloud Apps

[[using-nodejs-modules-overview]]
== Overview

This guide shows you how to include and use Node.js modules in your Cloud Apps. In the Red Hat Mobile Application
Platform ({ProductShortName}), you can use the modules of any Node.js package available in the registry to develop your Cloud Apps.
In the public registry - https://www.npmjs.com/[npmjs.com^] - you can find thousands of packages - frameworks,
connectors, and various tools.

Parts of functionality of {ProductShortName} itself are exposed as node modules. For example, when you create a new Cloud App on
the Platform, by default the _package.json_ will include a node module called __fh-mbaas-api__, which is the cornerstone
of the Mobile Backend As A Service (MBaaS) in {ProductShortName}.

== Getting Started with Node.js Modules

If you need a piece of functionality in your app and you don't want to reinvent the wheel, it's worth searching for
existing modules on npmjs.com.

For example, if you want to use the _Mongoose_ ODM framework, you can try looking at the official page of the
`mongoose` package in the registry - https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose[npmjs.com/package/mongoose^].

To use the latest version of the package in your project, running the following command in your Cloud App's directory
will install the package locally and add it as a dependency to the `package.json` file of your Cloud App:

[source,bash]
----
npm install --save mongoose
----

Alternatively, you can add the dependency to `package.json` manually, by appending it at the end of the `dependencies`
object, as in the following example:

[source,javascript]
----
{
    "name": "my-fh-app",
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "dependencies": {
        "body-parser": "~1.0.2",
        "cors": "~2.2.0",
        "express": "~4.0.0",
        "fh-mbaas-api": "~4.9.0",
        "mocha": "^2.1.0",
        "request": "~2.40.0",
        "mongoose": "~4.1.12" // added mongoose dependency
    }
}
----

At this point, you can start using the modules provided by the package. Often, the package page on npmjs.com contains
instructions for usage and links to documentation. The next step common to all modules is _requiring_ the module in your
code to be able to use it:

[source,javascript]
----
var mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/my_database');
...
----

In this example, the database URL is hard-coded in the source. A more common scenario, however, is using different
databases for different stages of development life cycle - development, testing, production. This can be resolved by
defining configuration values through environment variables.

== Environment Variables

If any part of the configuration of your Cloud App - such as hostnames, usernames, or passwords - varies between life
cycle stages, you can set such configuration values using environment variables. That allows you to make configuration
changes without changing the code. Every Cloud App has an _Environment Variables_ section in the Studio where you can
create or remove variables, set values, or push the variables to a running instance of the app.

Environment variables are especially useful in combination with the ability to _push_ different values to different
environments. For example, you could be using a different database host for testing and for production. Another benefit
is that sensitive configuration information can be stored outside of the code base of your application.

In a Cloud App, environment variables can be accessed through the `process.env` object. The previous example of a
Mongoose connect call changed to use environment variables would look this way:

[source,javascript]
----
mongoose.connect('mongodb://' + process.env.MONGO_HOST + '/' + process.env.MONGO_DB);
----
