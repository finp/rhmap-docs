[[sync-protocol]]
== Sync Protocol

The protocol for communication between the xref:sync-client[Sync Client] and the xref:sync-server[Sync Server]. +

[[sync-server]]
== Sync Server

The Sync Server is the server part of the
xref:sync-protocol[Sync Protocol], and is included in the fh-mbaas-api module. It:

* exposes the link:{CloudAPI}#fh-sync[Sync Server API] for integrating with a xref:dataset-backend[DataSet Backend]
* runs the xref:sync-server-loop[Sync Server Loop], updating xref:dataset[DataSets] when updates from a DataSet Backend are detected.

[[sync-client]]
== Sync Client

* exposes the link:{ClientAPI}#fh-sync[Sync Client API] to the front end for CRUDL actions against a xref:dataset[DataSet]
* runs the xref:sync-client-loop[Sync Client Loop], making a call to the xref:sync-server[Sync Server] at the specified xref:sync-frequency[Sync Frequency] for a particular xref:dataset[DataSet].

The Sync Client is the client part of the xref:sync-protocol[Sync Protocol]
There are 3 Sync Client implementations available:

* Javascript, in the
https://github.com/feedhenry/fh-sync-js/blob/master/src/sync-client.js[FeedHenry Javascript SDK]
* Objective C, in the
https://github.com/feedhenry/fh-ios-sdk/tree/master/fh-ios-sdk/Sync[FeedHenry iOS SDK]
* Java, in the
https://github.com/feedhenry/fh-android-sdk[FeedHenry Android SDK]

[[sync-server-loop]]
== Sync Server Loop

The Sync Server Loop is a function that runs continuously on the
xref:sync-server[Sync Server] with a 500ms wait between each run. +
During each run, it iterates over all xref:dataset-client[DataSet Clients] to
see if a xref:dataset[DataSet] should be synced from the
xref:dataset-backend[DataSet Backend].

[[sync-client-loop]]
== Sync Client Loop

The Sync Client Loop is a function that runs continuously on the
xref:sync-client[Sync Client] with a 500ms wait between each run. +
During each run, it iterates over all xref:dataset-client[DataSet Clients] to
see if a xref:dataset[DataSet] should be synced with the
xref:sync-server[Sync Server].

[[sync-frequency]]
== Sync Frequency

On the xref:sync-client[Sync Client], this is the interval between checks
for updates from the xref:sync-server[Sync Server] for a particular
xref:dataset[DataSet]. +
On the xref:sync-server[Sync Server], this is the interval between checks
for updates from the xref:dataset-backend[DataSet Backend] for a
particular xref:dataset[DataSet].

For more information, see xref:configuring-sync-frequency[Configuring Sync Frequency].

[[dataset]]
== DataSet

A DataSet is a collection of records synchronized between 1 or
more xref:sync-client[Sync Clients], the xref:sync-server[Sync Server]
and the xref:dataset-backend[DataSet Backend].

Red Hat recommends that you use an indexing strategy when working with data sets to improve performance.
For more information about indexing strategies for MongoDB, please see the link:https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/applications/indexes/[MongoDB Manual].

[[dataset-backend]]
== DataSet Backend

The system of record for data synchronized between the
xref:sync-client[Sync Client] and the xref:sync-server[Sync Server]. +
It can be any system that provides an API and can be integrated with
from the xref:sync-server[Sync Server], for example, a mysql database or a SOAP
service. +
The Sync Server exposes the link:{CloudAPI}#fh-sync[Sync Server API]
for integration with a DataSet Backend using xref:dataset-handler[DataSet
Handlers].

[[dataset-handler]]
== DataSet Handler

A DataSet Handler is a function for integrating the
xref:sync-server[Sync Server] into a xref:dataset-backend[DataSet
Backend]. +
There are many handlers for doing CRUDL actions on a
xref:dataset[DataSet] and managing collisions between
xref:dataset-record[DataSet Records]. +
The default implementation of these handlers uses fh.db (MongoDB backed
in an RHMAP MBaaS). +
You can override each of these handlers. See the
link:{CloudAPI}#fh-sync[Sync Server API] for details.

*IMPORTANT*: If you are overriding handlers, Red Hat recommends overriding
_all_ handlers to avoid unusual behavior with some handlers
using the default implementation and others using an overridden
implementation.

[[dataset-client]]
== DataSet Client

A DataSet Client is a configuration stored in the xref:sync-client[Sync
Client] & xref:sync-server[Sync Server] for each xref:dataset[DataSet]
that is actively syncing between the client & server. +
It contains data such as:

* the xref:sync-frequency[Sync Frequency] of the xref:dataset[DataSet]
* any query parameters to include when making calls to the
xref:dataset-backend[DataSet Backend]
* the latest xref:hash[Hash] of the xref:dataset-record[DataSet
Records]
* data regarding whether a sync with the xref:dataset-backend[DataSet Backend] is currently
in progress

[[dataset-record]]
== DataSet Record

A DataSet Record is an individual record in a xref:dataset[DataSet]. +
It contains:

* the raw data that this record represents, for example, the row values from a
MySQL table
* a xref:hash[Hash] of the raw data

[[hash]]
== Hash

There are 2 types of Hash used in the Sync Protocol:

* hash of an individual xref:dataset-record[DataSet Record] which is used to compare individual records to see if they are different.
* hash of all xref:dataset-record[DataSet Records] for a particular
xref:dataset-client[DataSet Client] which is used to compare a client's set of records with the servers without iterating over all records.
