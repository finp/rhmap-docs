== Upgrading the Database

If you need to perform database operations beyond those provided by the `$fh.db` API,  you can access the database directly using the MongoDB driver. To enable direct access to the database, it first has to be _upgraded_ - migrated to a dedicated instance.

To upgrade your app's database, click the _Upgrade Database_ button in the top right corner of the Data Browser screen.

The following steps are performed by the platform during the upgrade:

* Your app is stopped.
* A new database is created specifically for the app.
* The environment variable `FH_MONGODB_CONNURL` is set for your app, containing the database connection string, which can be passed to the MongoDB driver.

In addition, if the database already contained data:

* Data are migrated from the old database to the new one.
* If everything has succeeded, data are removed from the old database.
* Data are validated in the new database.

Note: you may also need to update the contents of your `application.js` and your `package.json` files. If this is the case, you will be informed on the migrate screen.

After all data migration steps have completed, you have to redeploy the app.

After the database upgrade is complete, new collections with the prefix `fhsync_` are created to enable sync functionality. Red Hat recommends that you keep these collections, even if you do not intend to use sync functionality.
