= Developing An Application Using Push Notifications

.Overview
This tutorial will guide you through the process of building a sample application which receives push notifications sent
from the Platform's built-in push notification server. The application you'll create in this example is based on Cordova
and targets Android and the associated Firebase Cloud Messaging (formerly Google Cloud Messaging) platform. However, the steps are analogous for all
other supported platforms.

To learn more about push notification support in the {ProductName}, see
link:{ProductFeatures}#push-notifications[Push Notifications].

[[obtain-fcm-credentials]]
== Obtain Firebase Cloud Messaging credentials and download the `google-services.json` file

For the built-in UnifiedPush Server (UPS) to be able to access Google's push notification network, you first need to
get a Server key and establish a project in the Firebase Console. See
https://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/aerogear-push-android/guides/#google-setup[Obtaining Firebase Cloud Messaging Credentials^]
for a detailed walk-through of getting the credentials. These instructions are for a native Android app, you do not need to complete all the process. In order to successfully complete the setup you need to obtain the following three items:

* Server key (formerly API key)
* Sender ID (formerly Project Number)
* the `google-services.json` file generated from the Firebase console

For other push networks, see link:{ProductFeatures}#obtaining-credentials-for-push-networks[Obtaining Credentials for Push Networks].

[[step-1-create-a-project-from-the-push-notification-hello-world-template]]
== Create a project from the _Push Notification Hello World_ template

image:push_hello_world_template.png[Push Notification Hello World template]

. In {ProductShortName} Studio, go to _Projects_ and click __New Project__.
. Look for the _Push Notification Hello World_ template, and click _Choose_ on the right-hand side.
. Enter a name for the project in the _Name your Project_ field.
. In the _App Templates_ section, look for __Simple Cordova Push App__. Make sure this app is selected and deselect all
other apps that can be deselected within the project template. The check boxes are in the top right corner of each app
template.
. Click _Create_ at the top right of the project template. Wait until the project creation is completed. Then click
_Finish_ at the bottom of the screen.


//[[step-2-define-a-package-name-for-your-client-app]]

[[step-3-set-up-push-support]]
== Set up push support

Push support needs to be explicitly enabled for each Client App and you also need to provide the push network
credentials obtained in the first step xref:obtain-fcm-credentials[Obtain Firebase Cloud Messaging credentials and download the `google-services.json` file].

image:push_enable_android_variant.png[Add Android variant]

. In the _Apps, Cloud Apps & Services_ section of your project, click the __Simple Cordova Push App__.
. Click _Push_ on the left side of the screen.
. Click __Enable Push__.
. Select the _Android_ option and enter the _Server key_ and _Sender ID_ obtained in the first step. Click __Enable Push__.

[[step-4-integrate-the-google-services-json-file-into-the-client-app]]
== Integrate the `google-services.json` file into the Client App

. Click _Editor_ on the left-hand side of the screen.
. Select the `www` folder in the Editor, click the `+` symbol in the toolbar to create a new file, and name it `google-services.json`.
. Open the `google-services.json` file you have previously downloaded from the Firebase Console, copy the contents into the `google-services.json` in the Editor.
. Click __File__, and then _Save_ in the Editor toolbar to save your changes.

[[step-4a-configure-config]]
== Configure config.xml file

Modify the `widget id` setting in the config.xml file to correspond to the package name defined in the Firebase Console.


[[step-5-build-the-client-app-binary]]
== Build the Client App binary

image:push_build_android.png[Build Client App binary for Android]

We will build a _Debug_ type of the Android binary which is easy to build without any special setup.

. Click _Build_ on the left-hand side of the screen.
. In the _Client Binary_ section, select __Android__.
. Click _Build_ at the bottom of the screen and wait until the app is built. You can monitor progress at the bottom of
the screen in the _Artifact History_ section.
. Once the build is finished, a dialog with a download link and a QR code should pop up. Alternatively, click
_Download_ in the first line of the _Artifact History_ table.
. With your mobile device, scan the presented QR code and install the app.

[[step-6-test-the-app]]
== Test the app

image:push_send_notification.png[Send push notification]

. On your mobile device, open the newly installed __Simple Cordova Push App__.
. In {ProductShortName}, open your project, and in __Apps, Clouds & Services__, open the __Simple Cordova Push App__.
. Click _Push_ on the left side of the screen.
. Click _Send Notification to this app_ at the top of the screen.
. Fill in the __Message__, keep all other fields unchanged, then click __Send Push Notification__.
. Shortly, your mobile device should receive a push notification with the provided message.



ifeval::[{ProductRelease} == 3]

To check logs for the push notification, navigate to the Client App in Studio and click _Push_ in the left-hand side of the screen, then choose the _Activity Log_ tab.
The log includes the following columns:

* Message - the text of the notification
* IP Address - the IP address of the cloud app that issued the push message request
* Installations - the number of clients that opened the notification
* Status - the status of the notification, 'Processed' means the notification has been received by * the Notification Service, 'Failed' means the notification has not been processed by the * Notification Service
* Sent - the timestamp for the notification leaving RHMAP
* First time opened - the timestamp for the first opening of the notification
* Last time opened - the timestamp for the most recent opening of the notification
