= Developing a Push Notification Application using AeroGear UnifiedPush Server

.Overview
This tutorial illustrates how to connect the community version of AeroGear UnifiedPush Server (UPS) deployed in your
OpenShift instance to the {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}).

You will build a set of sample applications for receiving sports news:

* *Mobile application* (__Push Notifications Mobile Client__): lets users subscribe to categories and receive a push
notification whenever a new story is posted in any of the chosen categories.
* *Web application* (__Push Console App__): lets administrators create and update the category list, as well as create
news stories and push them to clients.
* *Server application* (__Push Cloud App__): This Cloud App is the back end, containing the server-side logic. It
exposes API methods to manage categories (that is, different sports) and news stories associated with one or more
categories. The API of this app is called by the web and mobile application. This app communicates with the UnifiedPush
Server.

WARNING: The community version of UPS is not supported. For the officially supported way to use push notifications in your apps, see
link:{ServerSideDeveloperGuide}#developing-an-application-using-push-notifications[Developing An Application Using Push Notifications]

.Requirements
* {ProductShortName} account
* OpenShift Online account
* Mobile platform developer accounts (Google, Apple)

. In the _Editor_ menu, click _File_ then _Save_ to save the changes.

[[set-up-build-credentials]]
== Set up build credentials

This step is only required if you're building for iOS. If your target platform is Android, skip to xref:build-the-app[Step 8].

[[create-a-credential-bundle]]
=== Create a credential bundle

After you have obtained all necessary keys, certificates, and provisioning profiles from the mobile platform's developer
portals, a _Credential Bundle_ must be created to use them.

[NOTE]
These are the _Developer_ private keys and certificates for
the mobile platform (that is, iOS, Android, etc) which are *not* the same as the push certificate and private keys for
the platform. For iOS, you will also need the _Provisioning Profile_ for the application. If you did not already
create one in step 2, see
link:https://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/aerogear-push-ios/guides/#provisioning-profiles[these instructions^].
For more details on obtaining the _Developer_ private keys and certificates see each platform's documentation.

To create a credential bundle:

. If you are not already on the _Apps, Cloud Apps & Services_ page of your project, navigate to it.
. Click on the _Push Notifications Mobile Client_ under the _Apps_ column on the left side of the screen.
. Click on _Credentials_ in the menu on the left side of the screen.
+
image:credentials-bundle.png[Credentials Bundle]
. Click on the _Create New Bundle_ button on the right side of the screen.
. Choose the desired platform, enter the relevant information, and upload any profiles, keys, or certificates.
+
image:credentials-bundle-create.png[Create Credentials Bundle]
. Click the _Create Bundle_ button at the bottom of the screen.

[NOTE]
Ensure that you upload the correct profiles, keys, and
certificates intended for the mobile client. In addition, if any of those items are secured with passwords, you will
need to enter that information when building the client using any credential bundle with that secured item. If
_any_ of this information (profiles, keys, certificates, passwords, etc) is incorrect or not properly configured,
your mobile client may not build or install on your device.

[[set-up-the-bundle-identifier-or-package-name]]
=== Set up the Bundle Identifier or Package Name

Before building, depending on the desired platform, the _Bundle Identifier_ or _Package Name_ information must be set.

To set the _Bundle Identifier_ or __Package Name__:

. If you are not already on the _Apps, Cloud Apps & Services_ page of your project, navigate to it.
. Click on the _Push Notifications Mobile Client_ under the _Apps_ column on the left side of the screen.
. Click on _Config_ in the menu on the left side of the screen.
. Choose the desired platform (for example, iOS, Android, etc) from the menu on the left side of the screen.
+
image:client-bundle-id.png[Client Bundle ID]
. Enter the _Bundle Identifier_ or _Package Name_ in the appropriate text area and click the _Update Config_ button at
the bottom of the screen.

[NOTE]
Depending on the platform, you may need to set the same Bundle
Identifier or Package Name in multiple locations. For example, depending on how an iOS app is built, the Bundle
Identifier may need to be set in a combination of the iPhone, iPad, and/or iOS sections. When setting the Bundle
Identifier or Package Name in multiple locations, you will need to click the _Update Config_ button on
*each* screen before moving to the next location. If you change locations _before_ clicking
_Update Config_, your updates will be lost.

[[build-the-app]]
== Build the app

Once all the certificates and credentials have been configured, the _Push Notifications Mobile Client_ may be built for
a platform.

To build the _Push Notifications Mobile Client_ for a platform:

. If you are not already on the _Apps, Cloud Apps & Services_ page of your project, navigate to it.
. Click on the _Push Notifications Mobile Client_ under the _Apps_ column on the left side of the screen.
. Click on _Build_ in the menu on the left side of the screen.
. Choose the desired platform.
. Ensure that the proper _Build Type_ is configured.
. On certain platforms, other fields (for example, __Credential Bundle__, __Private Key Password__, etc.) may also need to be
entered.
+
image:client-build.png[Client Build]

. Click the _Build_ button at the bottom of the screen.
+
NOTE: If any item in the credential bundle being used is secured with a password, it must be entered when performing the build.

. Wait until the app is built. You can monitor progress at the bottom of the screen in the _Artifact History_ section.
. Once the build is finished, click _Download_ in the first line of the table.
. With your mobile device, scan the presented QR code and install the app.

[[test-the-app]]
== Test the app

At this point, the _Push Notifications Mobile Client_ is built for the desired platforms and is ready to receive push
notifications sent from the __Push Console App__, which uses the _Push Cloud App_ connected through the _Push Connector_
to the UPS deployed on OpenShift.

To test if this is working:

. Navigate to the _Apps, Cloud Apps & Services_ page of your project.
. Click on the _Push Console App_ application under the _Apps_ column.
. Use the _App Preview_ box on the right side of the screen to test the application.
You could also navigate to the URL listed next to __Current Host__.
+
image:push-test-add-category.png[Add Category]
. Create a couple of categories (for example, Football, Rugby and Basketball).
. Open the application on the device and select the categories you want to receive.
. In the studio, navigate to the _Apps, Cloud Apps & Services_ page of your project.
. Return to the _Push Console App_ and use the _App Preview_ box (or visit the _Current Host_ URL) to create a news
story and associate it with a category you subscribed to on your mobile device.
+
image:push-test-message.png[Create Message]
. Click _Send Push Notification_ and your mobile device should receive a push notification shortly.
+
image:push-device-notification.png[Send Message]

NOTE: In addition to building this example exercise, this template may
also be used as a starting point to create your own application that integrates with UPS.

[[common-issues]]
== Common Issues

[[checking-the-logs]]
=== Checking the Logs

If you are seeing issues during testing, review the {ProductShortName} and UnifiedPush Server (in OpenShift Online) logs for more
details. The _Push Cloud App_ and _Push Console App_ logs can be found by navigating to each app in the project and
clicking on _Logs_ on the left side of the screen. To access the logs in OpenShift Online, consult the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/OpenShift_Online/2.0/html/User_Guide/index.html[Openshift Online documentation^]. For more
information on debugging UPS, see
https://aerogear.org/docs/unifiedpush/ups_userguide/index/#debugging[Debugging the UnifiedPush Server^].

[[errors-being-logged-in-push-cloud-app-and-push-messages-not-reaching-client]]
=== Errors being logged in _Push Cloud App_ and push messages not reaching client

If push messages are being sent from the __Push Console App__, but not reaching the Client Apps, check the logs in the
_Push Cloud App_ for the following:

....
AeroGear Community Push Connector - err =  null  :: data =  code=401, message=You do not have permission to access this service.
....

This is most likely the result of the project not being added to the _Access Control_ area of the __Service Connector__.
Make sure you have completed Step 5, all environment variables have been pushed, and that *both* the _Service
Connector_ and _Push Cloud App_ are deployed and running. In the __Service Connector__, try updating the _Access Control_
area, saving the changes, re-pushing the environment variables, and restarting the service. Additionally, you could try
re-pushing the environment variables for the _Push Cloud App_ as well as restarting it.

[[mobile-client-build-failing-due-to-no-matching-provisioning-profiles-found]]
=== Mobile client build failing due to _No matching provisioning profiles found_

If your Client App is failing to build with the following error message:

....
[BUILD] 'Code Sign error: No matching provisioning profiles found: No provisioning profiles matching the bundle identifier "com.feedhenry.fhPushNotificationsMobileClient" were found.'
....

you may not have your Bundle IDs properly configured. Revisit section xref:set-up-the-bundle-identifier-or-package-name[Set up the Bundle Identifier or Package Name] and ensure:

* your bundle ID is correct and matches what you set up in the platform's (for example, Apple, Google, etc.) developer portal,
* your bundle ID is specified for *every* platform that you're building for (for example, make sure that your bundle ID is set
in __iOS__, __iPhone__, and _iPad_ if building for those platforms).
