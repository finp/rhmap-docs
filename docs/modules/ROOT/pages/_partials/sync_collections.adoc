[[fh-sync-collections]]
= MongoDB Collections Created by the Sync Server

[[overview]]
== Overview

The sync server will maintain various collections in MongoDB while it's running.

This document will explain what collections the sync server will create and their purpose.

NOTE: You should not modify these collections, as it may cause data loss.

== Sync Server Collections

All the collections created by the sync server will have the prefix *fhsync*.

=== *fhsync_pending_queue*

This collection is used to save the changes submitted from all the clients for all the Datasets.

Some of the useful fields for debugging are:

* *tries*: If the value is greater than 0, it means the change has been processed already by the sync server.
* *payload.hash*: The unique identifier of the pending change.
* *payload.cuid*: The unique id of the client.
* *payload.action*: The type of the change, like `create` or `update`.
* *payload.pre*: The data before the change was made.
* *payload.post*: The data after the change was made.
* *payload.timestamp*: When the change was made on the client.

=== *fhsync_<datasetId>_updates*

When a pending change from the `fhsync_pending_queue` collection is processed, the result is saved in this collection.
The client will get the result when they next sync, any trigger any relevant client notifications.

Some of the useful fields for debugging are:

* *hash*: The unique identifier of the pending change from the above collection.
* *type*: If the change is applied successfully. Possible values are `applied`, `failed` or `collision`.

=== *fhsync_ack_queue*

After a client gets the results of its submitted changes (as saved in the `fhsync_<datasetId>_updates` collection), it will confirm the acknowledgements with the server so that server can remove them.
This collection is used to save the acknowledgements submitted by the clients.

Some of the useful fields for debugging are:

* *payload.hash*: The unique identifier of a pending change from the *fhsync_pending_queue* collection.

=== *fhsync_datasetClients*

This collection is used to persist all the Dataset clients that are managed by the sync server.

Some of the useful fields for debugging are:

* *globalHash*: The current hash value of the Dataset Client.
* *queryParam*: The query parameters associated with the Dataset Client.
* *metaData*: The meta data associated with the Dataset Client.
* *recordUids*: The unique ids of all the records that belong to the Dataset Client.
* *syncLoopEnd*: When the last sync loop finished for the Dataset Client.

=== *fhsync_<datasetId>_records*

This data in this collection is a local copy of the data from the Dataset Backend.
It will help to speed up the sync requests from the clients, and also reduce the number of requests to the Dataset Backend.

Some of the useful fields for debugging are:

* *data*: The actual data of the record returned from the Dataset Backend.
* *uid*: The unique id of the record.
* *refs*: The ids of all the Dataset Clients that contain this record.

=== *fhsync_queue*

This collection is used to save the requests to sync *fhsync_<datasetId>_records* with the Dataset Backend.

Some of the useful fields for debugging are:

* *tries*: If it's greater than 0, it means the request is already processed by the sync server.

=== *fhsync_locks*

Only 1 worker is allowed to sync with the Dataset Backend at any given time.
To ensure that, a lock is used.
This collection is used to persist the lock.
It is unlikely you'll ever need to look at this collection, unless debugging an issue with the locking mechanism.

== Pruning the Queue Collections

For each of the queue collections, a document is not removed immediately after being processed.
Instead, it is marked as `deleted`.
This will allow developers to use them as an audit log, and also help with debugging.

To prevent these queues from using too much space, you can set a TTL (time to live) value for those messages. Once the TTL value is reached, these messages will be deleted from the database.

For more information, see the "queueMessagesTTL" option in link:{CloudAPI}#fh-set-config[$fh.sync.setConfig].
