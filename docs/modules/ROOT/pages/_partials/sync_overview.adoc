= Data Sync Framework

The {ProductShortName} mobile data synchronization framework includes the following features:

* Allows mobile apps to use and update data offline (local cache)
* Provides a mechanism to manage bi-directional data synchronization from multiple Client Apps using the Cloud App and into back-end data stores
* Allows data updates (that is, deltas) to be distributed from the Cloud App to connected clients
* Enables data collision management from multiple updates in the cloud
* Allows {ProductShortName} Apps to seamlessly continue working when the network connection is lost, and allows them to recover when the network connection is restored.

NOTE: Please refer to the Data Sync Framework Terminology defined in xref:sync-terminology[Sync terminology].

The Sync Framework comprises a set of Client App and Node.js Cloud App APIs.

The Client App does not access the back-end data directly.
Instead, it uses the Sync Client API to Read and List the data stored on the device and send changes (Creates, Updates, and Deletes) to the Cloud App.
Changes made to the data locally are stored in the local Sync Data Cache before being sent to the Cloud App.
The Client App receives notifications of changes to the remote dataset from the Sync Client API.

The Client App then uses the Client Sync Service to receive the changes (deltas) made to the remote dataset from the Cloud App and stores them in the Sync Data Cache. The Client App also sends Updates made locally to the Cloud App using the Client Sync Service.
When the Client App is off-line, cached updates are flushed to local storage on the device, allowing the changes to persist in case the Client App is closed before network connection is re-established.
The changes are pushed to the Cloud App the next time the Client App goes online.

The Cloud App does not access the Back End data directly, but only through the Sync Cloud API.
The Cloud App Uses the Sync Cloud API to receive updates from the Client App using the Client Sync Service.
These updates are stored in the Cloud App Sync Data Cache.
The Cloud App uses the Sync Cloud API to manage the Back End data in hosted storage using standard CRUDL (create, read, update, delete and list) and `collisionHandler` functions.

In addition to the standard data handler functions, the Cloud App can also employ user-defined data access functions.

[NOTE]
--
To use sync framework with Hosted RHMAP, you must upgrade your database. To upgrade the database:

. In the Data Browser section of the Cloud App page in Studio, click the *Upgrade Database* button in the top right corner, and confirm by clicking *Upgrade Now*. Wait until the upgrade process finishes.

. Redeploy the Cloud App by clicking *Deploy Cloud App* in the Deploy section.
+
After the database upgrade is complete, new collections with the prefix `fhsync_` are created to enable sync functionality. Red Hat recommends that you keep these collections, even if you do not intend to use sync functionality.

If you do not upgrade your database, you will encounter Internal Server Error (500).

To implement the Sync framework in your App:

. Init $fh.sync on the client side
+
[source,javascript]
----
  //See [JavaScript SDK API](../api/app_api.html#app_api-_fh_sync) for the details of the APIs used here

  var datasetId = "myShoppingList";

  //provide sync init options
  $fh.sync.init({
    "sync_frequency": 10,
    "do_console_log": true,
    "storage_strategy": "dom"
  });

  //provide listeners for notifications.
  $fh.sync.notify(function(notification){
    var code = notification.code
    if('sync_complete' === code){
      //a sync loop completed successfully, list the update data
      $fh.sync.doList(datasetId,
        function (res) {
          console.log('Successful result from list:', JSON.stringify(res));
          },
        function (err) {
          console.log('Error result from list:', JSON.stringify(err));
        });
    } else {
      //choose other notifications the app is interested in and provide callbacks
    }
  });

  //manage the data set, repeat this if the app needs to manage multiple datasets
  var query_params = {}; //or something like this: {"eq": {"field1": "value"}}
  var meta_data = {};
  $fh.sync.manage(datasetId, {}, query_params, meta_data, function(){

  });

.About Notifications
The Sync framework emits different types of notifications during the sync life cycle. Depending on your app's requirements, you can choose which type of notifications your app  listens to and add callbacks. However, it's not mandatory, the Sync framework performs synchronization without notification listeners.
+
Adding appropriate notification listeners helps improve the user experience of your app:

* Show critical error messages to the user in situations where Sync framework errors occur. For example, `client_storage_failed`.
* Log errors and failures to the console to help debugging. For example, `remote_update_failed`, `sync_failed`.
* Update the UI related to the sync data if delta is received, for example, there are changes to the data, you can use `delta_received`, `record_delta_received`.
* Monitor for collisions. 
+
Make sure to use $fh.sync APIs to perform CRUDL operations on the client.

. Init $fh.sync on the cloud side
+
This step is optional, and only required if you are overriding dataset options on the server, for example, modifying the sync loop frequency with the Dataset back end.
See the xref:sync-loop-considerations[Considerations] section below if changing the default sync frequency.
+
[source,javascript]
----
var fhapi = require("fh-mbaas-api");
var datasetId = "myShoppingList";

var options = {
  "syncFrequency": 10
};

fhapi.sync.init(datasetId, options, function(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    console.log('sync inited');
  }
});
----
+
You can now use the Sync framework in your app, or use the sample app to explore the basic usage: https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/sync-app[Client App^] and https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/sync-cloud[Cloud App^].
+
If the default data access implementations do not meet your requirements, you can provide override functions.

[[sync-loop-considerations]]
=== Avoiding Unnecessary Sync Loops

Because the client and server sync frequencies are set independently, two sync loops may be invoked per sync frequency if the server-side sync frequency differs from the client-side frequency.
Setting a long frequency on a client does not change the sync frequency on the server.
To avoid two sync loops, set the syncFrequency value of the dataset on the server to the sync_frequency value of the corresponding dataset on the client.

For example:

* syncFrequency on the server-side dataset is set to 120 seconds.
* sync_frequency on the client-side dataset is also set to 120 seconds.

However, if you require different frequencies on the client and server, you can set different values.

[[sync-advanced-usage]]
== Using Advanced Features of the Sync Framework

=== Define the Source Data for a Dataset

The Sync Framework provides hooks to allow the App Developer to define the source data for a dataset. Typically, the source data is an external database (MySql, Oracle, MongoDB etc), but this is not a requirement. The source data for a dataset can be anything, for example, csv files, FTP meta data, or even data pulled from multiple database tables. The only requirement that the Sync Framework imposes is that each record in the source data has a unique Id and that the data is provided to the Sync Framework as a JSON Object.

In order to synchronize with the back end data source, the App developer can implement code for synchronization.

For example, when listing data from back end, instead of loading data from database, you might want to return hard coded data:

. Init $fh.sync on the client side
+
This is the same as Step 1 in xref:basic-usage[Getting Started].

. Init $fh.sync on the cloud side and provide overrides.
+
[source,javascript]
----
var fhapi = require("fh-mbaas-api");
var datasetId = "myShoppingList";

var options = {
  "syncFrequency": 10
};

//provide hard coded data list
var datalistHandler = function(dataset_id, query_params, cb, meta_data){
  var data = {
    '00001': {
      'item': 'item1'
    },
    '00002': {
      'item': 'item2'
    },
    '00003': {
      'item': 'item3'
    }
  }
  return cb(null, data);
}

fhapi.sync.init(datasetId, options, function(err) {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    $fh.sync.handleList(datasetId, datalistHandler);
  }
});
