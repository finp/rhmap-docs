[[native-ios-objective-c-get-started]]
== Get Started

This SDK lets you use {ProductShortName} APIs in Objective-C apps for all iOS versions supported by {ProductShortName}.

The {ProductShortName} iOS Objective-C SDK is an open-source project hosted in the https://github.com/feedhenry/fh-ios-sdk[FeedHenry iOS SDK repository^] on Github. Feel free to fork it and make a contribution to this project.

Before using this SDK, make sure you have the Xcode IDE installed. You can download Xcode from the https://developer.apple.com/xcode/[Apple Developer Portal^].

If you plan to use https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html[CocoaPods^] to manage dependencies in your project, you must install it first:

[source,bash]
----
sudo gem install cocoapods
----

[[native-ios-objective-c-new-app]]
=== New App

When starting with a new template app, you have two options:

* either use CocoaPods (the recommended approach and the default in Studio)
* or use FH framework.

[[native-ios-objective-c-new-app-using-cocoapods]]
==== Using CocoaPods

Clone the https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/blank-ios-app/tree/cocoapods[sample app^] to get started with a new iOS application which has the {ProductShortName} SDK included as CocoaPods dependency.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/blank-ios-app.git
cd blank-ios-app
----

Fetch the dependencies defined in the https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/blank-ios-app/blob/cocoapods/Podfile[Podfile^]:

[source,bash]
----
pod install
----

Open the `blank-ios-app.xcworkspace` workspace in Xcode. The required dependencies are located in the Pods group.

[[native-ios-objective-c-new-app-using-fh-framework]]
==== Using FH Framework

Clone the https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/blank-ios-app/tree/cocoapods[sample app^] to get started with a new iOS application which has the {ProductShortName} SDK already included.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/blank-ios-app.git
----

Open the `blank-ios-app.xcworkspace` workspace in Xcode.

[[native-ios-objective-c-existing-app]]
=== Existing App

When you are integrating an existing app with {ProductShortName}, you have two options:

* if your app uses CocoaPods, add the FH SDK as a new pod,
* otherwise add the FH framework to your Xcode project.

[[native-ios-objective-c-existing-app-using-cocoapods]]
==== Using CocoaPods

Open the Podfile and add the following dependency:

----
pod FH, '3.1.1'
----

Replace `3.1.1` with the version of {ProductShortName} iOS Objective-C SDK you are targeting. If you do not specify a version number, the latest version in the CocoaPods central repository will be used.

[[native-ios-objective-c-existing-app-using-fh-framework]]
==== Using FH Framework

Download the SDK and save it as `fh-framework-latest.zip`.

To integrate the SDK, extract the `FH.framework` file from the Zip file you downloaded above.

Once downloaded, drag the `FH.framework` file to your Xcode Project.

image:ios_drag.png[image]

In the dialog, accept the defaults and click __Finish__.

[[native-ios-objective-c-integration]]
=== Integration

The {ProductShortName} iOS SDK has a number of framework and library dependencies -- you must re-configure your Build Phases to link against these frameworks and libraries at build time for the SDK to compile in your project correctly. The libraries you must link against are:

* `libxml2.dylib`
* `libz.dylib`
* `SystemConfiguration.framework`
* `CFNetwork.framework`
* `MobileCoreServices.framework`

To add these, go to *Build Phases > Link Binary with Libraries* and add the above dependencies as link dependencies.

image:ios_frameworks.png[image]

You will also need to add a Linker Flag to your app. To add this, go to the _Build Settings_ screen of your project's target. Use the search to find __Other linker flags__, and add the following:

`-Objective-C`

image:ios_config0.png[image]

Finally, add a Property List file called `fhconfig.plist` to your Project.

image:ios_config1.png[image]

image:ios_config2.png[image]

image:ios_config3.png[image]

[[native-ios-objective-c-setup]]
=== Setup

You must define the properties which allow your app to communicate with {ProductShortName} servers. Add the following values to the `fhconfig.plist` configuration file:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>host</key>
  <string>__RHMAP_Core_host__</string>
  <key>appid</key>
  <string>__Client_App_ID__</string>
  <key>projectid</key>
  <string>__Project_ID__</string>
  <key>appkey</key>
  <string>__Client_App_ API_key___</string>
  <key>connectiontag</key>
  <string>__Connection_tag__</string>
</dict>
</plist>
----

See link:{ProductFeatures}#projects-connections[Projects - Connections] for more information on connections between Client Apps and Cloud Apps.

[[native-ios-objective-c-initialization]]
=== Initialization

Before invoking any cloud requests from the {ProductShortName} iOS Swift SDK, you must first initialize it. Copy the following code snippet to your App Delegate's `didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method, or any other location which ensures the code is called before any cloud requests:

[source,objectivec]
----
#import <FH/FH.h>
#import <FH/FHResponse.h>

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
  // Override point for customization after application launch.

  // Call a cloud side function when init finishes
  void (^success)(FHResponse *)=^(FHResponse * res) {
    // Initialisation is now complete, you can now make FHActRequest's
    NSLog(@"SDK initialised OK");
  };

  void (^failure)(id)=^(FHResponse * res){
    NSLog(@"Initialisation failed. Response = %@", res.rawResponse);
  };

  //View loaded, init the library
  [FH initWithSuccess:success AndFailure:failure];

  return YES;
}
----
