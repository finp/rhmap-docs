= Using SAML for Authentication

[[using-saml-for-authentication-overview]]
== Overview

This tutorial demonstrates an example of using SAML authentication in a mobile application. Even though SAML is
currently not available as an authentication policy in {ProductName} ({ProductShortName}), we provide templates
which can be used as a starting point for your own solution.

The sample solution for SAML authentication consists of both the server-side logic and Client Apps:

* https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/saml-service[SAML Service^] -- a Cloud Service which acts as the __Service
Provider__, and uses http://passportjs.org/[Passport.js^] with
https://github.com/bergie/passport-saml[passport-saml^] to perform SAML 2.0 authentication

* https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/saml-cloud-app[SAML Cloud App^] -- a Cloud App which proxies requests from the
Client Apps to the SAML Service

Client Apps are provided for each platform:

* https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/saml-client-app[Cordova^]
* https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/saml-android-app[Android^]
* https://github.com/feedhenry-templates/saml-ios-app[iOS^]

[[introduction-to-saml]]
== Introduction to SAML

To explain the structure of the provided templates, let's first take a brief look at the concepts of SAML. There are
three actors in a SAML authentication scenario:

* *Principal* -- the user that is trying to access a protected resource provided by the Service Provider
* *Service Provider* (SP) -- a web application which provides a service to the Principal
* *Identity Provider* (IdP) -- a web service with the sole purpose of verifying the identity of the Principal and
providing identity assertions to the Service Provider

These actors interact in the process of authentication based on several assumptions:

* The Principal never shares his password or any other secrets with the Service Provider.
* The Identity Provider is trusted by both the Principal and the Service Provider.
* The Identity Provider can supply identity assertions to many Service Providers, thus enabling _Single Sign-On_ (SSO).

[[setting-up-the-templates]]
== Setting Up the Templates

First, you'll create the _SAML Service_ Cloud Service from the provided template. It's the core component of the
solution, acting as the Service Provider. The actual service provided in this example is showing the user details at the
endpoint `/session/valid`. There are several other endpoints to support the SAML authentication process:

* `/login` -- Redirects to the login screen of the IdP.
* `/session/login_host` -- Returns the URL of the login screen of the IdP.
* `/login/callback` -- The IdP posts an identity assertion to this endpoint, indicating a login success or failure.
* `/login/ok` -- The Client App gets redirected to this URL as an indication of login success.

Although the service is configured to use _Active Directory Federation Services 2.0_ (ADFS) as the IdP, it can be
configured to use any other SAML 2.0 compliant IdP with only minor adjustments.

[[create-the-saml-service]]
=== Create the SAML Service

. In the Studio, navigate to _Services & APIs_ and click __Provision MBaaS Service/API__.
. Find the _SAML Service_ template, click __Choose__, enter any name (for example, "SAML Service"), and click __Create__.
. Fill in the configuration details as follows:
* `SAML_ISSUER` -- Leave blank for now.
* `SAML_CALLBACK_URL` -- Leave blank for now.
* `SAML_ENTRY_POINT` -- Enter the URL to your ADFS endpoint.
* `SAML_AUTHN_CONTEXT` -- Enter the value `urn:federation:authentication:windows`.
* `SAML_CERT` -- For this demo, this can be left blank.
. Click _Next_ and wait until the service gets created. Then click __Finish__.

After the service is created and deployed, `SAML_ISSUER` and `SAML_CALLBACK_URL` need to be configured.

. In the _Service Details_ page, look at the _Current Host_ field and note its value. We'll refer to it in this example as `<mbaas-host>`. Also, note the value of __Service ID__.
. Click _Environment Variables_ in the menu on the left side.
. In the _App Environment Variables_ section, set the following value for both variables -- `SAML_ISSUER` and
`SAML_CALLBACK_URL` -- replacing `<mbaas-host>` with the value found in step 1:
+
....
<mbaas-host>/login/callback
....

[[set-up-the-project]]
=== Set Up the Project

First, create the project:

. In the Studio, navigate to _Projects_ and click _New Project_.
. Select the __SAML Example Project__, click __Choose__, enter any name (for example, "SAML Example"), and click _Create_.
. After the project gets created, click _Finish_.

Next, you have to associate the previously created SAML Service with the project:

. In the _MBaas Services_ column of the _SAML Example_ project, click _+_ to add a new service.
. Look for the previously created __SAML Service__, click it, and at the bottom of the screen, click _Associate Services_.

The Cloud App needs to have a reference to the SAML Service. Create an environment variable to point to it:

. Navigate to the _SAML Cloud_ Cloud App, and enter the _Environment Variables_ section on the left-hand side.
. In the _App Environment Variables_ section, click __Add Variable__, enter the following values, and click __Create__:
* Name: `SAML_SERVICE`
* Value: the previously noted _Service ID_ of the SAML Service
. Click _Push Environment Variables_ to propagate the environment variables to the runtime environment.

Now the apps are ready to be built, deployed, and tested.

[[how-it-works]]
== How It Works

Let's take a look at what happens during the authentication process.

When you click the *Sign In* button, the Client App calls the `sso/session/login_host` endpoint to retrieve the URL
of the login screen of the IdP. This URL is then opened in an in-app browser, to let you authenticate with the IdP.

.JavaScript
[source,javascript]
----
$('.sign-in-button').on('click', function(e) {
  $fh.cloud({
    path: 'sso/session/login_host',
    method: "POST",
    data: {
      "token": $fh._getDeviceId()
    }
  },
  function(res) {
    console.log('sso host:' + res.sso);
    var browser = cordova.InAppBrowser.open(res.sso, '_blank', 'location=yes');
...
----

.Android
[source,java]
----
JSONObject params = new JSONObject();
params.put(TOKEN, Device.getDeviceId(getApplicationContext()));

FHCloudRequest request = FH.buildCloudRequest(
  "sso/session/login_host", "POST", null, params);
request.executeAsync(new FHActCallback() {
  @Override
  public void success(FHResponse res) {
    Log.d(TAG, "FHCloudRequest (login_host) - success");
    String ssoStringURL = res.getJson().getString("sso");
    Log.d(TAG, "SSO URL = " + ssoStringURL);
    SAMLActivity.this.displayWebView(ssoStringURL);
  }
...
----

.iOS
[source,objectivec]
----
NSString* deviceID = [[FHConfig getSharedInstance] uuid];
NSMutableDictionary __params = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
params[@"token"] = deviceID;
FHCloudRequest __cloudReq = [FH buildCloudRequest:@"sso/session/login_host" WithMethod:@"POST" AndHeaders:nil AndArgs: params];

// Initiate the SSO call to the cloud
[cloudReq execWithSuccess:^(FHResponse _success) {
  NSLog(@"EXEC SUCCESS =%@", success);
  NSDictionary_ response = [success parsedResponse];
  NSString* urlString = response[@"sso"];
  NSURL* loginUrl = [[NSURL alloc] initWithString:urlString];
  // Display WebView
  FHSAMLViewController *controller = [[FHSAMLViewController alloc] initWithURL:loginUrl];
  [[[[UIApplication sharedApplication] keyWindow] rootViewController] presentViewController:controller animated:YES completion:nil];
...
----

After you enter the credentials required by the IdP and submit the login form, the IdP will post an identity assertion
back to the `/login/callback` endpoint of the SAML Service.

The SAML Service then does the following:

* associates the received SAML assertion with the users token, which is passed in the HTTP session
* persists data from the SAML assertion
* redirects the user to `/login/ok`, which signals an authentication success to the Client App

Once the user is successfully logged in, the in-app browser is closed, and the Client App can use the service provided
by the Service Provider -- call `sso/session/valid` to fetch the user details.

.JavaScript
[source,javascript]
----
$fh.cloud({
  path: 'sso/session/valid',
  method: "POST",
  data: {
    "token": $fh._getDeviceId()
  }
},
function(details) {
  $('.first_name').text(details.first_name);
  $('.last_name').text(details.last_name);
  $('.email').text(details.email);
  $('.expires').text(details.expires);
},
...
----

.Android
[source,java]
----
JSONObject params = new JSONObject();
params.put(TOKEN, Device.getDeviceId(getApplicationContext()));

FHCloudRequest request = FH.buildCloudRequest(
  "sso/session/valid", "POST", null, params);
  request.executeAsync(new FHActCallback() {
    @Override
    public void success(FHResponse res) {
      Log.d(TAG, "FHCloudRequest (valid) - success");
      User user = new User();
      user.setFirstName(res.getJson().getString("first_name"));
      user.setLastName(res.getJson().getString("last_name"));
      user.setEmail(res.getJson().getString("email"));
      user.setExpires(res.getJson().getString("expires"));

      Log.d(TAG, user.toString());

      SAMLActivity.this.displayUserData(user);
...
----

.iOS
[source,objectivec]
----
NSString* deviceID = [[FHConfig getSharedInstance] uuid];
NSMutableDictionary __params = [NSMutableDictionary dictionary];
params[@"token"] = deviceID;
FHCloudRequest __cloudReq = [FH buildCloudRequest:@"sso/session/valid" WithMethod:@"POST" AndHeaders:nil AndArgs: params];

// Initiate the SSO call to the cloud
[cloudReq execWithSuccess:^(FHResponse _success) {
  NSDictionary_ response = [success parsedResponse];
  // Manage next UI view controller
  [ self performSegueWithIdentifier: @"showLoggedIn" sender: response];
} AndFailure:^(FHResponse *failed) {
  NSLog(@"Request name failure =%@", failed);
}];
